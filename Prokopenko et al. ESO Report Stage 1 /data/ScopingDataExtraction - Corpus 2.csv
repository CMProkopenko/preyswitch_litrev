"Balme, G",2007,Feeding habitat selection by hunting leopards Panthera pardus in a woodland savanna: prey catchability versus abundance,foraging decisions; habitat selection; hunting strategy; leopard; Panthera pardus; prey abundance; predator-prey interaction; resource selection,"We used 44 months of radiotelemetry data to investigate the selection of feeding habitats by leopards in Phinda Private Game Reserve, South Africa. We assessed whether leopards hunted in certain habitats disproportionately to their availability and we investigated the factors influencing selection of feeding habitats. We also compared the number of kills and relative success rates of observed hunts in different vegetation types with available prey biomass and the degree of cover within each habitat. Leopards preferred hunting in habitats where prey was easier to catch rather than where prey was more abundant. However, in contrast to expectations, the apparent ‘catchability’ of prey was not proportional to the amount of cover provided by each habitat type. Instead, the probability of a kill occurring was greater in areas with intermediate cover levels, and these habitat types were favoured by leopards for hunting. There was no significant difference in the success rates of observed hunts in different habitats, suggesting that reduced detectability of prey in denser vegetation was the principal factor governing the decreased occurrence of kills there. Kleptoparasitism was relatively uncommon at Phinda, and there was no significant difference in the number of kills lost to other predators, or the likelihood of a carcass being hoisted in different vegetation types. Our results suggest that leopards are not ‘supergeneralists’ as widely portrayed and, at least in their choice of hunting habitat, show a degree of specialization that is previously undocumented. We suggest this is likely to influence local population densities and resilience to threats, and we discuss the need for fine-scale understanding of the species' ecological requirements in planning for its conservation."
"Bence, JR",1986,Prey Size Selection by the Mosquitofish: Relation to Optimal Diet Theory,density-dependent; optimal diet; predation; satiation; size selection,"We investigated size-selective predation upon Daphnia pulex and D. magna by the mosquitofish (Gambusia). The independent variables were the relative size of predator and prey, prey density, and predator satiation. Gambusia actively chose to attack small prey (which we showed to be more profitable). Gambusia's preference increased monotonically, or decreased, or peaked at an intermediate prey size, depending upon fish size, prey size, and fish satiation level. These results contrast with the hypothesis that ""gape-limited predators"" select the largest prey available, and ""sizelimited predators"" select small or intermediate-sized prey. Optimal diet theory predicts that a predator should drop less profitable prey items from the diet at higher prey densities. In contrast, Gambusia maintained a mixed diet and its preferences did not change in response to changes in either the absolute or the relative abundance of prey. Moreover, the ingestion rate would have been higher if less profitable (larger) prey types had been ignored. Gambusia did sharply alter its size-selective feeding behavior in response to its own satiation level, and we expect that this factor is correlated with prey density in the field. Well-fed fish concentrated their attacks, to a greater degree than starved fish, on small, more profitable prey. They also ingested less biomass per unit time. This last result suggests that maximizing food intake per unit time may not be the goal of well-fed fish, and that different criteria may determine the profitability of prey at different prey densities."
"Bissett, C",2012,The response of lions (Panthera leo) to changes in prey abundance on an enclosed reserve in South Africa,"Diet switching, Large predators, Predator–prey interaction, Prey preferences","Large mammalian carnivores place significant pressure on their prey populations and this is exacerbated within the fenced reserves of Africa. However, foraging theory predicts that diet switching by predators may mitigate this pressure. In this study, we use data collected between 2003 and 2007 from an enclosed system in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa to examine the response of lions Panthera leo to changes in the abundance of two important prey species — kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and warthog Phacochoerus africanus. As the relative abundance of warthogs increased, the number of kudu kills decreased significantly, whereas warthog kills became significantly more frequent. A similar pattern was observed for lion prey preference and the switch from kudu to warthog was also reflected in a significant decrease in the mean prey mass. Our results suggest that a diet shift occurs in lions and that the change in diet is primarily in response to an increase in warthog numbers. Prey switching may promote the persistence of predator–prey systems, which is particularly important for fenced systems where natural immigration of prey is not possible. However, continued collection and analysis of long-term observational data from the multipredator, multiprey systems of Africa is required to facilitate a full understanding of predator–prey dynamics."
"Bos, D",2007,Prey selection by the dasyurid Ningaui yvonneae,,"We know little about the availability of potential prey and patterns of prey consumption by Ningaui yvonneae in a natural environment. This information is important to understanding how the species is able to exploit its semiarid environment. Here, we examine the diet of N. yvonneae inhabiting a semiarid mallee community in South Australia using a combination of faecal analysis and observations of nocturnally foraging animals. Prey consumption was compared with the availability of prey types in the environment, and comparisons made between habitat components, across seasons and between sexes. N. yvonneae was found to include a range of prey types in its diet, with 11 invertebrate taxa recorded from direct observation and eight of these detected in the scats. Prey taxa consumed most often by freely foraging ningauis were Araneae, Blattodea and Orthoptera, while those most commonly detected in scats were Hymenoptera and Araneae. In comparison, 22 invertebrate taxa were recorded in pitfall traps, although many of these were recorded infrequently. Taxa most commonly recorded in traps were Hymenoptera, Collembola, Coleoptera and Acariformes. Observational data also indicated that consumption of prey taxa differed significantly between sexes and among seasons. Males generally consumed a more diverse array of prey, with both observational and scat data showing that they were more likely to consume Hymenoptera and Isoptera, while females were more likely to consume Lepidoptera and Hemiptera. Variability between seasons was evident in consumption of invertebrate grubs (recorded only during ‘growth’; February–April), Orthoptera (recorded most often during ‘breeding’, August–October), and Araneae (recorded more often during ‘maturation’, May–July). However percentage occurrence data from the scats lacked this seasonality, possibly because of the smaller array of prey taxa recorded. N. yvonneae captured prey from all available habitat components, with five of the most frequently recorded prey taxa being recorded from all components. Leaf litter and Triodia were the most commonly recorded capture sites (45% and 22% of captures respectively), and males and females used the habitat components in a similar manner. Although N. yvonneae is like many other dasyurids in having a largely generalist insectivorous diet, comparisons of prey consumed with their availability in the environment indicated that individuals did show some selectivity towards certain taxa, particularly Blattodea, Orthoptera, Chilopoda, Lepidoptera and Araneae."
"Chetri, M",2017,"Snow Leopard and Himalayan Wolf: Food Habits and Prey Selection in the Central Himalayas, Nepal",,"Top carnivores play an important role inmaintaining energy flow and functioning ofthe ecosystem, and aclear understanding oftheir diets and foraging strategies isessential for developing effective conservation strategies. Inthis paper, we compared diets and prey selection ofsnow leopards and wolves based on analyses ofgenotyped scats (snow leopards n=182, wolves n=57), collected within 26 sampling grid cells (5×5 km) that were distributed across avast landscape ofca 5000 km2 inthe Central Himalayas, Nepal. Within the grid cells, we sampled prey abundances using the double observer method. We found that interspecific differences indiet composition and prey selection reflected their respective habitat preferences,i.e. snow leopards significantly preferred cliff-dwelling wild ungulates (mainly bharal, 57% ofidentified material inscat samples), whereas wolves preferred typically plain-dwellers (Tibetan gazelle, kiang and argali, 31%). Livestock was consumed less frequently than their proportional availability by both predators (snow leopard =27%; wolf = 24%), but significant avoidance was only detected among snow leopards. Among livestock species, snow leopards significantly preferred horses and goats, avoided yaks, and used sheep as available. We identified factors influencing diet composition using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Wolves showed seasonal differences inthe occurrence ofsmall mammals/birds, probably due tothe winter hibernation ofan important prey, marmots. For snow leopard, occurrence ofboth wild ungulates and livestock inscats depended on sex and latitude. Wild ungulates occurrence increased while livestock decreased from south tonorth, probably due toalatitudinal gradient inprey availability. Livestock occurred more frequently inscats from male snow leopards (males: 47%, females: 21%), and wild ungulates more frequently inscats from females (males: 48%, females: 70%). The sexual difference agrees with previous telemetry studies on snow leopards and other large carnivores, and may reflect ahigh-risk high-gain strategy among males."
"Elliott, JM",2004,Prey switching in four species of carnivorous stoneflies,"Dinocras cephalotes, Isoperla grammatica, Perla bipunctata, Perlodes microcephalus, Plecoptera","1. Previous studies compared the functional responses to their prey, and both intraspecific and interspecific interference, in mature larvae of Dinocras cephalotes, Perla bipunctata, Isoperla grammatica and Perlodes microcephalus. The present study examines switching by larvae of the same species presented with different proportions of two contrasting prey types; larvae of Baetis rhodani and Chironomus sp. In each experiment, 200 prey were arranged in nine different combinations of the two prey types (20 : 180, 40 : 160, 60 : 140, 80 : 120, 100 : 100, 120 : 80, 140 : 60, 160 : 40, 180 : 20). Prey were replaced as they were eaten. A model predicted the functional response in the absence of switching and provided a null hypothesis against which any tendency for switching could be tested. 2. No evidence for prey switching by Dinocras and Perla was obtained, both species showing a slight preference for Baetis over Chironomus. Prey switching occurred in Isoperla and Perlodes. As the relative abundance of one prey type increased in relation to the alternative, the proportion eaten of the former prey changed from less to more than expected from its availability, the relationship being described by an S-shaped curve. Isoperla and Perlodes switched to a preference for Baetis when its percentage of the total available prey exceeded 57 and 42%, respectively. Equivalent values for Chironomus were 43 and 58% for Isoperla and Perlodes, respectively. Switching was strongest in Perlodes. 3. Non-switching in Dinocras and Perla was related to their feeding strategy, both species being more successful when using a non-selective ambush strategy at dusk and dawn rather than a search strategy during the night. Both Isoperla and Perlodes used a search strategy. The smaller Isoperla fed chiefly at dusk and dawn, and preferred Chironomus larvae, whereas most of the larger Perlodes fed continuously from dusk to dawn and preferred Baetis larvae."
"Fester, KSM",2021,Spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta feeding ecology and selectivity of large herbivorous prey in the Namib desert,"Crocuta crocuta, feeding ecology, prey selection, spotted hyaena","We have investigated the relationship between spotted hyaenas in the south Namib Desert and large herbivorous prey and have summarized an updated overview of predator-prey relationships in this resource-limited arid environment. Over the 52month study, we recorded the densities (#/km−2, ±SE) of the four local large herbivorous prey species: gemsbok (1.229, ±0.50), springbok (1.352, ±0.48), ostrich (0.648, ±0.23), and greater kudu (0.343, ±0.00). A fecal analysis was performed on 146 collected spotted hyaena scats, and prey items were identified and hairs cross-follicle analyzed to the species level. Spotted hyaena diet at the study area remained opportunistic with 240 identified prey items representing eight differing prey species being recorded, ranging from ostrich eggs to large ungulates. The Ivlev's Electivity Index was used to determine which large herbivorous prey was most selected for. Although gemsbok had a higher representation of prey items in the sampled scats, all sampled large herbivorous prey species scored below 0 and are thus generally avoided in relation to their availability in the environment. If any prey preferences are expressed by spotted hyaena in the Namib, it can be presumed to be a nonsampled prey species. We therefore promote further detailed investigations into all other prey species present, and seasonal variations of prey densities and scat sampling, within the study environment."
"Hellström, P",2014,Functional responses of the rough-legged buzzard in a multi-prey system,Predation; Rodent Cycles; Lemmus; Subarctic,"The functional response is a key element of predator–prey interactions. Basic functional response theory explains foraging behavior of individual predators, but many empirical studies of free-ranging predators have estimated functional responses by using population-averaged data. We used a novel approach to investigate functional responses of an avian predator (the rough legged-buzzard Buteo lagopus Pontoppidan, 1763) to intra-annual spatial variation in rodent density in subarctic sweden, using breeding pairs as the sampling unit. the rough-legged buzzards responded functionally to norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus l. 1758), grey-sided voles (Myodes rufocanus sundevall, 1846) and field voles (Microtus agrestis l. 1761), but different rodent prey were not utilised according to relative abundance. the functional response to norwegian lemmings was a steep type II curve and a more shallow type III response to grey-sided voles. the different shapes of these two functional responses were likely due to combined effects of differences between lemmings and grey-sided voles in habitat utilisation, anti-predator behaviour and size-dependent vulnerability to predation. Diet composition changed less than changes in relative prey abundance, indicating negative switching, with high disproportional use of especially lemmings at low relative densities. Our results suggest that lemmings and voles should be treated separately in future empirical and theoretical studies in order to better understand the role of predation in this study system."
"Hoy, SR",2021,Negative frequency-dependent prey selection by wolves and its implications on predator–prey dynamics,age structure; Alces alces; Canis lupus; Cervus canadensis; demographic structure; diet selection; foraging strategy; frequency-dependent selection; predator-prey dynamics; selective predation,"Many species exhibit selective foraging behaviour, where consumers use a nonrandom subset of available food types. Yet little is known about how selective foraging behaviour varies with environmental conditions and the community level consequences of such selection dynamics. We examined selective foraging by wolves preying primarily on elk in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) over a 12-year period and on moose in Isle Royale National Park (IRNP) over a 47-year period. Specifically, we assessed how selection for calves and senescent adults varied with their frequency in the environment, wolf abundance and winter severity. Selection for senescent adults decreased as the relative abundance of senescent prey increased (i.e. negative frequency-dependent selection) in both study sites. In IRNP, selection for calves was also negatively frequency dependent and declined with increasing wolf abundance. These results are inconsistent with the pattern of positive frequency-dependent selection expected under the preyswitching hypothesis. These results suggest that selection is primarily driven by intraspecific differences in prey vulnerability and wolves’ interest in minimizing their risk of injury, as opposed to maximizing intake rates. Lastly, we ran simulations to evaluate how predatoreprey dynamics were influenced by dynamic patterns of selection, like those observed in YNP and IRNP. The simulations indicated that predators are more efficient (i.e. steeper slope of the numerical response) when selection for calves is negatively frequency dependent, which results in a lower mean abundance of prey. More importantly, predation is a stronger destabilizing force when selection for calves is negatively frequency dependent. That stronger destabilizing force is indicated by greater variability in the abundance of prey and predators, prey populations being less resilient and a steeper negative slope of the relationship between predation rate and prey population growth rate. As such, our simulation analyses suggest that some of the observed patterns of negative-frequency dependent selection may have important consequences for predatoreprey dynamics."
"McCard, M",2021,Pushing the switch: functional responses and prey switching by invasive lionfish may mediate their ecological impact,Frequency-dependent predation; Interaction strength; Invader impact prediction; Marine biology; Pterois volitans,"Biodiversity is declining on a global scale and the spread of invasive alien species (IAS) is a major driver, particularly through predatory impacts. Thus, effective means of assessing and predicting the consequences of IAS predation on native prey population stability remains a vital goal for conservation. Here, we applied two classic ecological concepts, consumer functional response (FR) and prey switching, to predict and understand the ecological impacts of juveniles of the lionfish (Pterois volitans), a notorious and widespread marine invader. Functional responses and prey switching propensities were quantified towards three representative prey species: Artemia salina, Palaemonetes varians, and Gammarus oceanicus. Lionfish exhibited potentially destabilising Type II FRs towards individual prey species, owing to high consumption rates at low prey densities, whilst FR magnitudes differed among prey species. Functional response attack rates (a) were highest, and handling times (h) lowest, towards A. salina, followed by P. varians and then G. oceanicus. Maximum feeding rates (1/h) and functional response ratios (FRR; a/h) also followed this impact gradient for the three prey species. Lionfish, however, displayed a potentially population stabilising prey switching propensity (i.e. frequency-dependent predation) when multiple prey species were presented simultaneously, where disproportionately less of rare prey, and more of abundant prey, were consumed. Whilst FR and FRR magnitudes indicate marked per capita lionfish predatory impacts towards prey species, a strong prey switching propensity may reduce in-field impacts by offering low density prey refuge in biodiverse communities. Our results thus corroborate field patterns documenting variable impacts of lionfish, with prey extirpations less likely in diverse communities owing to frequency-dependent predation."
"Murdoch, WW",1969,Switching in General Predators: Experiments on Predator Specificity and Stability of Prey Populations,,"Switching' in predators which attack several prey species potentially can stabilize the numbers in prey populations. In switching, the number of attacks upon a species is disproportionately large when the species is abundant relative to other prey, and disproportionately small when the species is relatively rare. The null case for two prey species can be written: P""1/P""2 = cN""1/N""2, where P""1/P""2 is the ratio of the two prey expected in the diet, N""1/N""2 is the ratio given and c is a proportionality constant. Predators were sea-shore snails and prey were mussels and barnacles. Experiments in the laboratory modelled aspects of various natural situations. When the predator had a strong preference (c) between prey the data and the 'null case' model were in good agreement. Preference could not altered by subjecting predators to training regimens. When preference was weak the data did not fit the model replicates were variable. Predators could be trained easily to one or other prey species. From a number of experiments it was concluded that in the weak-preference case no switch would occur in nature except where there is an opportunity for predators to become trained to the abundant species. A patchy distribution of the abundant prey could provide this opportunity. Given one prey species, snails caused a decreasing percentage mortality as prey numbers increased. This occurred also with 2 prey species present when preference was strong. When preference was weak the form of the response was unclear. When switching occurred the percentage prey mortality increased with prey density, giving potentially stabilizing mortality. The consequences of these conclusions for prey population regulation and for diversity are discussed."
"Murdoch, WW",1975,Switching in Predatory Fish,Density dependence; feeding; fish; populations; predation; prey; stability; switching,"Guppies (Poecilia ieticulatus) were given two prey: Drosoplhila (on the water surface) and tubificid worms (on the aquarium bottom). The densities of the two prey were varied gradually over 12 days, from 4:1 to 1:4, and we measured the predators' diets, time of each meal, and time spent at the top, middle, and bottom of the aquarium. The guppies switched, attacking disproportionately whichever of the two prey was more abundant. Switching resulted when the fish increased the fraction of time spent at the surface as the fraction of Drosoplhila available increased. They did this in response to changing reward rates. Switching caused density-dependent mortality. Differences between two groups of fish show that switching behavior is more efficient and should be selected for. The result confirms previous generalizations about switching."
"Ostfeld, RS",1982,Foraging strategies and prey switching in the California sea otter,Dietary items; poor success rate; electivity index; prey switching; profitable prey,"Southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis), in recovering from near extinction, are gradually extending their range to include areas from which they have been absent for more than one hundred years. This study took advantage of the otters' relatively sudden arrival in the area near Santa Cruz, California, to monitor their prey selection in the first two years of residence there. Foraging observations revealed that sea urchins (Strongly-locentrotus franciscanus) were heavily preyed upon initially, but virtually disappeared from the diet after one year of sea otter residence. The disappearance of sea urchins was accompanied by an increased use of kelp crabs (Pugettia producta) and the appearance of clams (Gari californica) in the otters' diet. Abalones (Haliotis rufescens) and cancer crabs (Cancer spp.) remained fairly stable as dietary items throughout the two year period. An electivity index was used to quantify sea otter preferences, which corresponded closely with a ranking scheme based on energy intake/unit foraging time calculated for each major prey species. As predicted by optimal foraging theory, sea otters prefer food species of high rank and replace depleted dietary items with those of next highest rank. The process of dietary switching was analyzed with respect to foraging success rates, and it appears that poor success rates, associated with predation on an increasingly rarer prey species (sea urchins), drive sea otters to hunt for different prey. Both patch selection and search image formation appear to function in this process. The potential effects on community structure and stability of predators exhibiting a preference for the most profitable prey are discussed."
"Randa, LA",2009,Prey Switching of Sympatric Canids in Response to Variable Prey Abundance,"Canis latrans, competition avoidance, coyote, Illinois, log-linear analysis, prey selection, prey switching, red fox, Vulpes vulpes","We investigated the effects of fluctuating prey numbers on the foraging strategies and potential mechanisms for coexistence of 2 sympatric predators, coyotes (Canis latrans) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), in a heterogeneous environment in northeastern Illinois. We quantified the availability of mammalian and avian prey across different habitats, analyzed scats collected along standardized routes for occurrence of prey items, and estimated the number and biomass of vertebrate prey consumed. Abundances of the most frequently consumed prey (voles, rabbits, and mice) differed significantly over time, especially in relation to an ice storm that occurred during the study. Coyotes and red foxes tended to select voles and rabbits in number, rabbits in biomass, and incorporated greater numbers and biomass of other prey such as deer, pheasants, and sciurids after the ice storm. Log-linear analyses indicated that both coyotes and red foxes exhibited switching behavior, with differential shifts among the number and biomass of alternative prey they consumed. Hence, foraging strategies of coyotes and red foxes appeared to be a combination of prey selectivity and switching behavior. Our study suggests that competition between coyotes and red foxes for similar primary prey species and limited environments to exploit at the urban–rural interface may contribute to displacement of red foxes by coyotes."
"Tallian, A",2017,Predator foraging response to a resurgent dangerous prey,antipredator behaviour; bison; dangerous prey; elk; frequency-dependent predation; prey switching; prey vulnerability; scavenging; wolves; Yellowstone National Park,"Prey switching occurs when a generalist predator kills disproportionately more of an abundant prey species and correspondingly spares a rarer species. Although this behaviour is a classic stabilizing mechanism in food web models, little is known about its operation in free-living systems which often include dangerous prey species that resist predation. We used long-term (1995–2015) data from a large mammal system in northern Yellowstone National Park, USA, to understand how prey preference of a wild, generalist predator (Canis lupus) responds to a shift in prey species evenness involving rising numbers of dangerous prey (Bison bison) and dropping numbers of relatively safer prey (Cervus elaphus). Contrary to the prey switching hypothesis, wolves attacked and killed disproportionately more of the rarer, but safer, species. Wolves maintained a strong preference against bison even when this species was nearly twice as abundant as elk. [Correction added after online publication on 26 April 2017: ‘more than’ changed to ‘nearly’]. There was also evidence that wolves were increasingly averse to hunting bison as relative bison abundance increased. Wolves seldom hunted bison because capture success was limited to a narrow set of conditions: larger packs (>11 wolves) chasing smaller herds (10–20 bison) with calves. Wolves scavenged bison carrion instead and did so more frequently as bison abundance increased. Our study demonstrates the overarching importance of prey vulnerability to understanding the prey preferences of generalist predators in ecological communities with dangerous prey. The formidable defences of such prey diminish the potential for switching and its stabilizing influence on population dynamics. In these communities, shifts from hunting to scavenging are perhaps more likely than shifts in prey preference. The assumption of switching may therefore overestimate the stability of multi-prey systems that include dangerous prey species. A lay summary is available for this article."
