"Balme, G"	2007	Feeding habitat selection by hunting leopards Panthera pardus in a woodland savanna: prey catchability versus abundance	foraging decisions; habitat selection; hunting strategy; leopard; Panthera pardus; prey abundance; predator-prey interaction; resource selection	"We used 44 months of radiotelemetry data to investigate the selection of feeding habitats by leopards in Phinda Private Game Reserve, South Africa. We assessed whether leopards hunted in certain habitats disproportionately to their availability and we investigated the factors influencing selection of feeding habitats. We also compared the number of kills and relative success rates of observed hunts in different vegetation types with available prey biomass and the degree of cover within each habitat. Leopards preferred hunting in habitats where prey was easier to catch rather than where prey was more abundant. However, in contrast to expectations, the apparent â€˜catchabilityâ€™ of prey was not proportional to the amount of cover provided by each habitat type. Instead, the probability of a kill occurring was greater in areas with intermediate cover levels, and these habitat types were favoured by leopards for hunting. There was no significant difference in the success rates of observed hunts in different habitats, suggesting that reduced detectability of prey in denser vegetation was the principal factor governing the decreased occurrence of kills there. Kleptoparasitism was relatively uncommon at Phinda, and there was no significant difference in the number of kills lost to other predators, or the likelihood of a carcass being hoisted in different vegetation types. Our results suggest that leopards are not â€˜supergeneralistsâ€™ as widely portrayed and, at least in their choice of hunting habitat, show a degree of specialization that is previously undocumented. We suggest this is likely to influence local population densities and resilience to threats, and we discuss the need for fine-scale understanding of the species' ecological requirements in planning for its conservation."
"Bence, JR"	1986	Prey Size Selection by the Mosquitofish: Relation to Optimal Diet Theory	density-dependent; optimal diet; predation; satiation; size selection	"We investigated size-selective predation upon Daphnia pulex and D. magna by the mosquitofish (Gambusia). The independent variables were the relative size of predator and prey, prey density, and predator satiation. Gambusia actively chose to attack small prey (which we showed to be more profitable). Gambusia's preference increased monotonically, or decreased, or peaked at an intermediate prey size, depending upon fish size, prey size, and fish satiation level. These results contrast with the hypothesis that ""gape-limited predators"" select the largest prey available, and ""sizelimited predators"" select small or intermediate-sized prey. Optimal diet theory predicts that a predator should drop less profitable prey items from the diet at higher prey densities. In contrast, Gambusia maintained a mixed diet and its preferences did not change in response to changes in either the absolute or the relative abundance of prey. Moreover, the ingestion rate would have been higher if less profitable (larger) prey types had been ignored. Gambusia did sharply alter its size-selective feeding behavior in response to its own satiation level, and we expect that this factor is correlated with prey density in the field. Well-fed fish concentrated their attacks, to a greater degree than starved fish, on small, more profitable prey. They also ingested less biomass per unit time. This last result suggests that maximizing food intake per unit time may not be the goal of well-fed fish, and that different criteria may determine the profitability of prey at different prey densities."
"Bergelson, JM"	1985	A Mechanistic Interpretation of Prey Selection by Anax junius Larvae (Odonata: Aeschnidae)	Anax junius; capture success; foraging behavior; mechanism; Odonata; optimal diet theory; optimal foraging; prey switching; rule of thumb; search image	"Preferential orientation, pursuit, and capture by a predator have been proposed for the establishment of prey preference and prey switching; however, very little is known about which of these behaviors is actually involved in active prey selection. Based on laboratory arena experiments in which the proportions of two prey types were manipulated, I distinguished the specific foraging process underlying prey preference and prey switching in nymphs of the dragonfly Anax junius. Dragonfly nymphs showed a higher probability of pursuing the more abundant of two prey types than predicted from relative prey frequencies. An increase pursuit probability was correlated with an increased capture success on the abundant prey type. I hypothesize that prey selection in Anax junius nymphs results from a simple behavioral rule of thumb; ""Continue to pursue only those prey types you have successfully captured in the immediate past."""
"Bissett, C"	2012	The response of lions (Panthera leo) to changes in prey abundance on an enclosed reserve in South Africa	"Diet switching, Large predators, Predatorâ€“prey interaction, Prey preferences"	"Large mammalian carnivores place significant pressure on their prey populations and this is exacerbated within the fenced reserves of Africa. However, foraging theory predicts that diet switching by predators may mitigate this pressure. In this study, we use data collected between 2003 and 2007 from an enclosed system in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa to examine the response of lions Panthera leo to changes in the abundance of two important prey species â€” kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and warthog Phacochoerus africanus. As the relative abundance of warthogs increased, the number of kudu kills decreased significantly, whereas warthog kills became significantly more frequent. A similar pattern was observed for lion prey preference and the switch from kudu to warthog was also reflected in a significant decrease in the mean prey mass. Our results suggest that a diet shift occurs in lions and that the change in diet is primarily in response to an increase in warthog numbers. Prey switching may promote the persistence of predatorâ€“prey systems, which is particularly important for fenced systems where natural immigration of prey is not possible. However, continued collection and analysis of long-term observational data from the multipredator, multiprey systems of Africa is required to facilitate a full understanding of predatorâ€“prey dynamics."
"Elliott, JM"	2004	Prey switching in four species of carnivorous stoneflies	"Dinocras cephalotes, Isoperla grammatica, Perla bipunctata, Perlodes microcephalus, Plecoptera"	"1. Previous studies compared the functional responses to their prey, and both intraspecific and interspecific interference, in mature larvae of Dinocras cephalotes, Perla bipunctata, Isoperla grammatica and Perlodes microcephalus. The present study examines switching by larvae of the same species presented with different proportions of two contrasting prey types; larvae of Baetis rhodani and Chironomus sp. In each experiment, 200 prey were arranged in nine different combinations of the two prey types (20 : 180, 40 : 160, 60 : 140, 80 : 120, 100 : 100, 120 : 80, 140 : 60, 160 : 40, 180 : 20). Prey were replaced as they were eaten. A model predicted the functional response in the absence of switching and provided a null hypothesis against which any tendency for switching could be tested. 2. No evidence for prey switching by Dinocras and Perla was obtained, both species showing a slight preference for Baetis over Chironomus. Prey switching occurred in Isoperla and Perlodes. As the relative abundance of one prey type increased in relation to the alternative, the proportion eaten of the former prey changed from less to more than expected from its availability, the relationship being described by an S-shaped curve. Isoperla and Perlodes switched to a preference for Baetis when its percentage of the total available prey exceeded 57 and 42%, respectively. Equivalent values for Chironomus were 43 and 58% for Isoperla and Perlodes, respectively. Switching was strongest in Perlodes. 3. Non-switching in Dinocras and Perla was related to their feeding strategy, both species being more successful when using a non-selective ambush strategy at dusk and dawn rather than a search strategy during the night. Both Isoperla and Perlodes used a search strategy. The smaller Isoperla fed chiefly at dusk and dawn, and preferred Chironomus larvae, whereas most of the larger Perlodes fed continuously from dusk to dawn and preferred Baetis larvae."
"Fester, KSM"	2021	Spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta feeding ecology and selectivity of large herbivorous prey in the Namib desert	"Crocuta crocuta, feeding ecology, prey selection, spotted hyaena"	"We have investigated the relationship between spotted hyaenas in the south Namib Desert and large herbivorous prey and have summarized an updated overview of predator-prey relationships in this resource-limited arid environment. Over the 52month study, we recorded the densities (#/kmâˆ’2, Â±SE) of the four local large herbivorous prey species: gemsbok (1.229, Â±0.50), springbok (1.352, Â±0.48), ostrich (0.648, Â±0.23), and greater kudu (0.343, Â±0.00). A fecal analysis was performed on 146 collected spotted hyaena scats, and prey items were identified and hairs cross-follicle analyzed to the species level. Spotted hyaena diet at the study area remained opportunistic with 240 identified prey items representing eight differing prey species being recorded, ranging from ostrich eggs to large ungulates. The Ivlev's Electivity Index was used to determine which large herbivorous prey was most selected for. Although gemsbok had a higher representation of prey items in the sampled scats, all sampled large herbivorous prey species scored below 0 and are thus generally avoided in relation to their availability in the environment. If any prey preferences are expressed by spotted hyaena in the Namib, it can be presumed to be a nonsampled prey species. We therefore promote further detailed investigations into all other prey species present, and seasonal variations of prey densities and scat sampling, within the study environment."
"HellstrÃ¶m, P"	2014	Functional responses of the rough-legged buzzard in a multi-prey system	Predation; Rodent Cycles; Lemmus; Subarctic	"The functional response is a key element of predatorâprey interactions. Basic functional response theory explains foraging behavior of individual predators, but many empirical studies of free-ranging predators have estimated functional responses by using population-averaged data. We used a novel approach to investigate functional responses of an avian predator (the rough legged-buzzard Buteo lagopus Pontoppidan, 1763) to intra-annual spatial variation in rodent density in subarctic sweden, using breeding pairs as the sampling unit. the rough-legged buzzards responded functionally to norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus l. 1758), grey-sided voles (Myodes rufocanus sundevall, 1846) and field voles (Microtus agrestis l. 1761), but different rodent prey were not utilised according to relative abundance. the functional response to norwegian lemmings was a steep type II curve and a more shallow type III response to grey-sided voles. the different shapes of these two functional responses were likely due to combined effects of differences between lemmings and grey-sided voles in habitat utilisation, anti-predator behaviour and size-dependent vulnerability to predation. Diet composition changed less than changes in relative prey abundance, indicating negative switching, with high disproportional use of especially lemmings at low relative densities. Our results suggest that lemmings and voles should be treated separately in future empirical and theoretical studies in order to better understand the role of predation in this study system."
"Hoy, SR"	2021	Negative frequency-dependent prey selection by wolves and its implications on predatorâ€“prey dynamics	age structure; Alces alces; Canis lupus; Cervus canadensis; demographic structure; diet selection; foraging strategy; frequency-dependent selection; predator-prey dynamics; selective predation	"Many species exhibit selective foraging behaviour, where consumers use a nonrandom subset of available food types. Yet little is known about how selective foraging behaviour varies with environmental conditions and the community level consequences of such selection dynamics. We examined selective foraging by wolves preying primarily on elk in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) over a 12-year period and on moose in Isle Royale National Park (IRNP) over a 47-year period. Specifically, we assessed how selection for calves and senescent adults varied with their frequency in the environment, wolf abundance and winter severity. Selection for senescent adults decreased as the relative abundance of senescent prey increased (i.e. negative frequency-dependent selection) in both study sites. In IRNP, selection for calves was also negatively frequency dependent and declined with increasing wolf abundance. These results are inconsistent with the pattern of positive frequency-dependent selection expected under the preyswitching hypothesis. These results suggest that selection is primarily driven by intraspecific differences in prey vulnerability and wolvesâ€™ interest in minimizing their risk of injury, as opposed to maximizing intake rates. Lastly, we ran simulations to evaluate how predatoreprey dynamics were influenced by dynamic patterns of selection, like those observed in YNP and IRNP. The simulations indicated that predators are more efficient (i.e. steeper slope of the numerical response) when selection for calves is negatively frequency dependent, which results in a lower mean abundance of prey. More importantly, predation is a stronger destabilizing force when selection for calves is negatively frequency dependent. That stronger destabilizing force is indicated by greater variability in the abundance of prey and predators, prey populations being less resilient and a steeper negative slope of the relationship between predation rate and prey population growth rate. As such, our simulation analyses suggest that some of the observed patterns of negative-frequency dependent selection may have important consequences for predatoreprey dynamics."
"Hughes, RN"	1993	"An Experimental Analysis of Frequency-Dependent Predation (Switching) in the 15-Spined Stickleback, Spinachia spinachia"	"switching, frequency-dependent predation, prey-profitability, searching image, 15-spined stickleback"	"1. Fifteen-spined sticklebacks were fed successively changing proportions of contrasted prey, either Gammarus and Artemia or Chaoborus and Artemia, in a series of experiments designed to identify factors contributing to frequency-dependent predation (switching). 2. In all experiments, fish showed the sigmoid response to changing relative abundances of prey, typical of switching. The response showed a time-lag in the order of 30 min (length of a single trial) but, apart from this lag, responses were independent of whether the previous frequency of a particular prey item which had been exposed to the fish was higher or lower than the current frequency. 4. Profitabilities changed with relative abundance, as a result of improved handling efficiency, but did not become transposed in rank. 5. Preferred prey were maintained at sufficient densities to exclude the possibility of a simple optimal foraging explanation of switching. 6. Under most conditions, sticklebacks concentrated their searching towards the bottom of the aquarium, so area-restricted searching did not contribute to switching. 7. Searching modes were similar for all prey. 8. Changing attack efficiency was associated with switching in experiments with Gammarus and Artemia, but not in those with Chaoborus and Artemia. 9. Searching-image formation may have contributed to switching in all cases. Strong supportive evidence, however, was found only in the experiments with Chaoborus and Artemia, in which prey were attacked in non-random sequences, but in which attack efficiency changed little. 10. The time-scale of the switching response in 15-spined sticklebacks is appropriate to the tidal fluctuations in abundance of their natural prey, gammarids and mysids. Switching, however, is unlikely to have a significant effect on the populations of these prey."
"Lacher, TE"	1982	Food Preference as a Function of Resource Abundance with Multiple Prey Types: An Experimental Analysis of Optimal Foraging Theory		"Data were collected on the response of a small population of folivores (Kerodon rupestris: Caviidae) to changes in the absolute abundance of 10 different species of leaves. When absolute abundances were tripled (relative abundances were held constant) the folivore population significantly altered its proportional consumption of food types. In general, preferred foods were consumed in greater relative proportions when abundance was increased and the relative utilization of less preferred foods declined. Otherwise, our results were problematic in relation to the assumptions and predictions of the energy maximization model of optimal foraging theory. First, not all foods of low rank decreased in consumption when we increased the abundance of high-ranked foods. The partial consumption of low-ranked foods (or partial preferences as referred to in the literature) is contrary to the tenets of energy maximization. Second, preferences did not remain consistent from phase to phase. In fact, ranks shifted considerably, especially with respect to high-ranked foods. A number of factors may have been responsible for these contradictions to optimal foraging theory. Folivores may represent an example of the special case of optimal foraging with nutrient constraints (Pulliam 1980). The partial consumption of low-ranked foods would then be expected in this situation. Also, the encounter rate for a given item or type is probably not constant in time or space; the rate of encounter is an ephemeral value, affected by an animal's degree of satiation, and dependent upon its degree of familiarity with the distribution of food items within its foraging area. This suggests that animals are optimal foragers, sensu Charnov, only in the short term. The probability of accepting an item when it is encountered will be either zero or one in the short term, but in the long term (hours, days, seasons, years) it will assume an average value between zero and one. Finally, consumers should evolve search images for types or species, when within-type variability is very small and overlap among types minimal. When within-type variability is large, and distributions of food value overlap a great deal, natural selection should favor consumers that select high value items and do not generalize on a type's average values. We present a scenario which proposes that feeding habits may influence the way a consumer optimizes its foraging behavior. Empirical tests of optimal foraging models based upon energy maximization have upheld theoretical predictions when predators were presented with limited prey choices (e.g., Goss-Custard 1977; Krebs et al. 1977). Tests which have examined more complex situations (Zach and Smith 1980; this paper) suggest that models which include considerations of nutrient constraints (Pulliam 1975) or predator learning (Hughes 1979; Stenseth and Hansson 1979; Pulliam 1980) may, in fact, be more appropriate."
"McCard, M"	2021	Pushing the switch: functional responses and prey switching by invasive lionfish may mediate their ecological impact	Frequency-dependent predation; Interaction strength; Invader impact prediction; Marine biology; Pterois volitans	"Biodiversity is declining on a global scale and the spread of invasive alien species (IAS) is a major driver, particularly through predatory impacts. Thus, effective means of assessing and predicting the consequences of IAS predation on native prey population stability remains a vital goal for conservation. Here, we applied two classic ecological concepts, consumer functional response (FR) and prey switching, to predict and understand the ecological impacts of juveniles of the lionfish (Pterois volitans), a notorious and widespread marine invader. Functional responses and prey switching propensities were quantified towards three representative prey species: Artemia salina, Palaemonetes varians, and Gammarus oceanicus. Lionfish exhibited potentially destabilising Type II FRs towards individual prey species, owing to high consumption rates at low prey densities, whilst FR magnitudes differed among prey species. Functional response attack rates (a) were highest, and handling times (h) lowest, towards A. salina, followed by P. varians and then G. oceanicus. Maximum feeding rates (1/h) and functional response ratios (FRR; a/h) also followed this impact gradient for the three prey species. Lionfish, however, displayed a potentially population stabilising prey switching propensity (i.e. frequency-dependent predation) when multiple prey species were presented simultaneously, where disproportionately less of rare prey, and more of abundant prey, were consumed. Whilst FR and FRR magnitudes indicate marked per capita lionfish predatory impacts towards prey species, a strong prey switching propensity may reduce in-field impacts by offering low density prey refuge in biodiverse communities. Our results thus corroborate field patterns documenting variable impacts of lionfish, with prey extirpations less likely in diverse communities owing to frequency-dependent predation."
"Metz, MC"	2012	Seasonal patterns of predation for gray wolves in the multi-prey system of Yellowstone National Park	"additive predation, compensatory predation, GPS collar, kill rate, marrow fat, neonate predation, predatorâ€“prey, summer predation"	"1. For large predators living in seasonal environments, patterns of predation are likely to vary among seasons because of related changes in prey vulnerability. Variation in prey vulnerability underlies the influence of predators on prey populations and the response of predators to seasonal variation in rates of biomass acquisition. Despite its importance, seasonal variation in predation is poorly understood. 2. We assessed seasonal variation in prey composition and kill rate for wolves Canis lupus living on the Northern Range (NR) of Yellowstone National Park. Our assessment was based on data collected over 14 winters (1995â€“2009) and five springâ€“summers between 2004 and 2009. 3. The species composition of wolf-killed prey and the age and sex composition of wolf-killed elk Cervus elaphus (the primary prey for NR wolves) varied among seasons. 4. Oneâ€™s understanding of predation depends critically on the metric used to quantify kill rate. For example, kill rate was greatest in summer when quantified as the number of ungulates acquired per wolf per day, and least during summer when kill rate was quantified as the biomass acquired per wolf per day. This finding contradicts previous research that suggests that rates of biomass acquisition for large terrestrial carnivores tend not to vary among seasons. 5. Kill rates were not well correlated among seasons. For example, knowing that early-winter kill rate is higher than average (compared with other early winters) provides little basis for anticipating whether kill rates a few months later during late winter will be higher or lower than average (compared with other late winters). This observation indicates how observing, for example, higherthan-average kill rates throughout any particular season is an unreliable basis for inferring that the year-round average kill rate would be higher than average. 6. Our work shows how a large carnivore living in a seasonal environment displays marked seasonal variation in predation because of changes in prey vulnerability. Patterns of wolf predation were influenced by the nutritional condition of adult elk and the availability of smaller prey (i.e. elk calves, deer). We discuss how these patterns affect our overall understanding of predator and prey population dynamics."
"Murdoch, WW"	1969	Switching in General Predators: Experiments on Predator Specificity and Stability of Prey Populations		"Switching' in predators which attack several prey species potentially can stabilize the numbers in prey populations. In switching, the number of attacks upon a species is disproportionately large when the species is abundant relative to other prey, and disproportionately small when the species is relatively rare. The null case for two prey species can be written: P""1/P""2 = cN""1/N""2, where P""1/P""2 is the ratio of the two prey expected in the diet, N""1/N""2 is the ratio given and c is a proportionality constant. Predators were sea-shore snails and prey were mussels and barnacles. Experiments in the laboratory modelled aspects of various natural situations. When the predator had a strong preference (c) between prey the data and the 'null case' model were in good agreement. Preference could not altered by subjecting predators to training regimens. When preference was weak the data did not fit the model replicates were variable. Predators could be trained easily to one or other prey species. From a number of experiments it was concluded that in the weak-preference case no switch would occur in nature except where there is an opportunity for predators to become trained to the abundant species. A patchy distribution of the abundant prey could provide this opportunity. Given one prey species, snails caused a decreasing percentage mortality as prey numbers increased. This occurred also with 2 prey species present when preference was strong. When preference was weak the form of the response was unclear. When switching occurred the percentage prey mortality increased with prey density, giving potentially stabilizing mortality. The consequences of these conclusions for prey population regulation and for diversity are discussed."
"Murdoch, WW"	1975	Switching in Predatory Fish	Density dependence; feeding; fish; populations; predation; prey; stability; switching	"Guppies (Poecilia ieticulatus) were given two prey: Drosoplhila (on the water surface) and tubificid worms (on the aquarium bottom). The densities of the two prey were varied gradually over 12 days, from 4:1 to 1:4, and we measured the predators' diets, time of each meal, and time spent at the top, middle, and bottom of the aquarium. The guppies switched, attacking disproportionately whichever of the two prey was more abundant. Switching resulted when the fish increased the fraction of time spent at the surface as the fraction of Drosoplhila available increased. They did this in response to changing reward rates. Switching caused density-dependent mortality. Differences between two groups of fish show that switching behavior is more efficient and should be selected for. The result confirms previous generalizations about switching."
"Ostfeld, RS"	1982	Foraging strategies and prey switching in the California sea otter	Dietary items; poor success rate; electivity index; prey switching; profitable prey	"Southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis), in recovering from near extinction, are gradually extending their range to include areas from which they have been absent for more than one hundred years. This study took advantage of the otters' relatively sudden arrival in the area near Santa Cruz, California, to monitor their prey selection in the first two years of residence there. Foraging observations revealed that sea urchins (Strongly-locentrotus franciscanus) were heavily preyed upon initially, but virtually disappeared from the diet after one year of sea otter residence. The disappearance of sea urchins was accompanied by an increased use of kelp crabs (Pugettia producta) and the appearance of clams (Gari californica) in the otters' diet. Abalones (Haliotis rufescens) and cancer crabs (Cancer spp.) remained fairly stable as dietary items throughout the two year period. An electivity index was used to quantify sea otter preferences, which corresponded closely with a ranking scheme based on energy intake/unit foraging time calculated for each major prey species. As predicted by optimal foraging theory, sea otters prefer food species of high rank and replace depleted dietary items with those of next highest rank. The process of dietary switching was analyzed with respect to foraging success rates, and it appears that poor success rates, associated with predation on an increasingly rarer prey species (sea urchins), drive sea otters to hunt for different prey. Both patch selection and search image formation appear to function in this process. The potential effects on community structure and stability of predators exhibiting a preference for the most profitable prey are discussed."
"Paine, RT"	1969	"The Pisaster-Tegula Interaction: Prey Patches, Predator Food Preference, and Intertidal Community Structure"		"The herbivorous gastropod Tegula ifunebralis is not highly ranked in a food preference hierarchy of its major- predator, the starfish Pisaster ochraceus, and exhibits a persistent broad overlap with it in the rocky intertidal zone at Mukkaw Bay, Washington. Observations on Tegula over a 5-yr period indicate that it settles high intertidally, lives there for 5-6 yr, and then tends to migrate lower into contact with Pisaster. Tegula lays down an annual growth line permitting it to be aged and a growth curve constructed. Analysis of relative growth and reproduction indicates that beyond a certain size (16 mm) large individuals perform less well in the upper than those in the lower intertidal zone. Pisaster consumes 25-28% of the adult Tegula per year in the area of spatial overlap, based on analysis of the age structure of 6-17 yr old Tegula, and by direct estimates of the percentage of the standing crop consumed annually. The relationship between Pisaster and sex ratio, relative energy limitation and reproductive output (fitness) of Tegula is discussed for three subpopulations. It is suggested that the implied results of the interaction is typical of that between a major predator and one of its less preferred prey. The prominent zonation exhibited by preferred prey, the observed intimacy of association of predator and less preferred prey, and the zoogeographic homogeneity of the Pacific rocky coastline community are discussed in relation to three intermeshing ecological processes."
"Randa, LA"	2009	Prey Switching of Sympatric Canids in Response to Variable Prey Abundance	"Canis latrans, competition avoidance, coyote, Illinois, log-linear analysis, prey selection, prey switching, red fox, Vulpes vulpes"	"We investigated the effects of fluctuating prey numbers on the foraging strategies and potential mechanisms for coexistence of 2 sympatric predators, coyotes (Canis latrans) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), in a heterogeneous environment in northeastern Illinois. We quantified the availability of mammalian and avian prey across different habitats, analyzed scats collected along standardized routes for occurrence of prey items, and estimated the number and biomass of vertebrate prey consumed. Abundances of the most frequently consumed prey (voles, rabbits, and mice) differed significantly over time, especially in relation to an ice storm that occurred during the study. Coyotes and red foxes tended to select voles and rabbits in number, rabbits in biomass, and incorporated greater numbers and biomass of other prey such as deer, pheasants, and sciurids after the ice storm. Log-linear analyses indicated that both coyotes and red foxes exhibited switching behavior, with differential shifts among the number and biomass of alternative prey they consumed. Hence, foraging strategies of coyotes and red foxes appeared to be a combination of prey selectivity and switching behavior. Our study suggests that competition between coyotes and red foxes for similar primary prey species and limited environments to exploit at the urbanâ€“rural interface may contribute to displacement of red foxes by coyotes."
"Silva, SI"	1995	Numerical and functional response of burrowing owls to long-term mammal fluctuations in Chile	burrowing owl; Chile; functional response; mammal fluctuation; numerical response; speotyto cunnicularia	"Most studies to date indicate that the burrowing owl (Speotyto cunicularia) is a generalist species that eats variable combinations of vertebrates and invertebrates, mainly small mammals and insects. These combinations vary through time, and thus the burrowing owl has been labeled a seasonally opportunist species. However, because of the numerically higher incidenceof insects in its diet, this species has been ascribed to insectivorous trophic guilds. We found that burrowing owls in mediterranean Chile: (1) consistently consumed more invertebrates than vertebrates but the biomass contribution of these two categories was the reverse, (2) co-varied in number of resident individuals with the density of small mammals in the field, (3) decreased the castingof pellets with insects as mammal densities increased, and (4) increased the frequency of mammals in the diet as the latter increased in the field. We propose that Chilean burrowing owls displayed both numerical and functional responses to the abundance of local small mammals, thus suggesting that they depended more heavily on this prey type than on insects. Perhaps Chilean burrowing owls should be classified trophically as carnivorous instead of as insectivorous predators."
"Tallian, A"	2017	Predator foraging response to a resurgent dangerous prey	antipredator behaviour; bison; dangerous prey; elk; frequency-dependent predation; prey switching; prey vulnerability; scavenging; wolves; Yellowstone National Park	"Prey switching occurs when a generalist predator kills disproportionately more of an abundant prey species and correspondingly spares a rarer species. Although this behaviour is a classic stabilizing mechanism in food web models, little is known about its operation in free-living systems which often include dangerous prey species that resist predation. We used long-term (1995â€“2015) data from a large mammal system in northern Yellowstone National Park, USA, to understand how prey preference of a wild, generalist predator (Canis lupus) responds to a shift in prey species evenness involving rising numbers of dangerous prey (Bison bison) and dropping numbers of relatively safer prey (Cervus elaphus). Contrary to the prey switching hypothesis, wolves attacked and killed disproportionately more of the rarer, but safer, species. Wolves maintained a strong preference against bison even when this species was nearly twice as abundant as elk. [Correction added after online publication on 26 April 2017: â€˜more thanâ€™ changed to â€˜nearlyâ€™]. There was also evidence that wolves were increasingly averse to hunting bison as relative bison abundance increased. Wolves seldom hunted bison because capture success was limited to a narrow set of conditions: larger packs (>11 wolves) chasing smaller herds (10â€“20 bison) with calves. Wolves scavenged bison carrion instead and did so more frequently as bison abundance increased. Our study demonstrates the overarching importance of prey vulnerability to understanding the prey preferences of generalist predators in ecological communities with dangerous prey. The formidable defences of such prey diminish the potential for switching and its stabilizing influence on population dynamics. In these communities, shifts from hunting to scavenging are perhaps more likely than shifts in prey preference. The assumption of switching may therefore overestimate the stability of multi-prey systems that include dangerous prey species. A lay summary is available for this article."
"Toscano, BJ"	2010	Multiple prey effects: Agonistic behaviors between prey species enhances consumption by their shared predator	Apparent competition; interference competition; multiple predator effects (MPEs); predator-prey; refuge space; trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs)	"Multiple prey species may affect consumption by their shared predator in a non-additive fashion which cannot be predicted by summing pairwise predatorâ€“prey interactions within food webs. By manipulating prey species richness and identity in experimental mesocosms, we sought to explore the effects of interspecific prey interactions between pinfish Lagodon rhomboides and pigfish Orthopristis chrysoptera,andbetweenbluecrabs Callinectes sapidus and common mud crabs Panopeus herbstii on the consumption rates of a shared predator species, gulf toadfish Opsanus beta. We also determined the effects of these interactions on the survivorship of the prey species as mediated by the predator. In both fish and crab prey trials, interspecific interactions between multiple prey increased the overall consumption rate of O. beta, and in each case, one prey species was harmed (decreased survivorship) while the other prey species was not significantly affected by these interactions (all relative to single-prey treatments). In trials run with fish prey, behavioral observations revealed that L. rhomboides aggressively chased O. chrysoptera out of a seagrass refuge and into a surrounding sand matrix where O. beta foraged, thus increasing O. chrysoptera vulnerability to predation. In trials run with crab prey, C. sapidus failed to reduce their activity in the presence of O. beta.Inaddition,P. herbstii displaced C. sapidus from the seagrass refuge in mixed prey treatments, and so these conspicuous behaviors primarily occurred in the unstructured sand habitat where C. sapidus were more vulnerable to predation. We conclude that multiple prey effects, including those involving risk-enhancing, agonistic interactions between prey, can be important determinants of predatorâ€“prey outcomes. This may be especially true when refuge space is limited."
"Wade, PR"	2007	Killer Whales and Marine Mammal Trends in the North Pacificâ€”a Re-Examination of Evidence for Sequential Megafauna Collapse and the Prey-Switching Hypothesis	"North Pacific, killer whale, Steller sea lion, sea otter, harbor seal, fur seal, ecosystem, predation, whaling, population dynamics"	"Springer et al. (2003) contend that sequential declines occurred in North Pacific populations of harbor and fur seals, Steller sea lions, and sea otters. They hypothesize that these were due to increased predation by killer whales, when industrial whalingâ€™s removal of large whales as a supposed primary food source precipitated a prey switch. Using a regional approach, we reexamined whale catch data, killer whale predation observations, and the current biomass and trends of potential prey, and found little support for the prey-switching hypothesis. Large whale biomass in the Bering Sea did not decline as much as suggested by Springer et al., and much of the reduction occurred 50â€“100 yr ago, well before the declines of pinnipeds and sea otters began; thus, the need to switch prey starting in the 1970s is doubtful. With the sole exception that the sea otter decline followed the decline of pinnipeds, the reported declines were not in fact sequential. Given this, it is unlikely that a sequential megafaunal collapse from whales to sea otters occurred. The spatial and temporal patterns of pinniped and sea otter population trends are more complex than Springer et al. suggest, and are often inconsistent with their hypothesis. Populations remained stable or increased in many areas, despite extensive historical whaling and high killer whale abundance. Furthermore, observed killer whale predation has largely involved pinnipeds and small cetaceans; there is little evidence that large whales were ever a major prey item in high latitudes. Small cetaceans (ignored by Springer et al.) were likely abundant throughout the period. Overall, we suggest that the Springer et al. hypothesis represents a misleading and simplistic view of events and trophic relationships within this complex marine ecosystem."
"Wells, BK"	2017	Environmental conditions and prey-switching by a seabird predator impact juvenile salmon survival	California Current; Chinook salmon; Common murre; Ecosystems; Forage fish; Inland water environment	"Due to spatio-temporal variability of lower trophic-level productivity along the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), predators must be capable of switching prey or foraging areas in response to changes in environmental conditions and available forage. The Gulf of the Farallones in central California represents a biodiversity hotspot and contains the largest common murre (Uria aalge) colonies along the CCE. During spring, one of the West Coast's most important Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations out-migrates into the Gulf of the Farallones. We quantify the effect of predation on juvenile Chinook salmon associated with ecosystemlevel variability by integrating long-term time series of environmental conditions (upwelling, river discharge), forage species abundance within central CCE, and population size, at-sea distribution, and diet of the common murre. Our results demonstrate common murres typically forage in the vicinity of their offshore breeding sites, but in years in which their primary prey, pelagic young-of-year rockfish (Sebastes spp.), are less available they forage for adult northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) nearshore. Incidentally, while foraging inshore, common murre consumption of out-migrating juvenile Chinook salmon, which are collocated with northern anchovy, increases and population survival of the salmon is significantly reduced. Results support earlier findings that show timing and strength of upwelling, and the resultant forage fish assemblage, is related to Chinook salmon recruitment variability in the CCE, but we extend those results by demonstrating the significance of top-down impacts associated with these bottom-up dynamics. Our results demonstrate the complexity of ecosystem interactions and impacts between higher trophic-level predators and their prey, complexities necessary to quantify in order to parameterize ecosystem models and evaluate likely outcomes of ecosystem management options."
