## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(naniar)
library(knitr)
library(skimr)
```


```{r}
set.seed(17)
Subsample.100 <- sample(c(1:12161), size=100, replace=F)
sort(Subsample.100, decreasing = F)
```



```{r}
set.seed(8)
Full.text.sample.10 <- sample(c(1:55), size=10, replace=F)
sort(Full.text.sample.10, decreasing = F)
```


```{r}
set.seed(30)
String.2.Subsample.100 <- sample(c(1:17797), size=100, replace=F)
sort(String.2.Subsample.100, decreasing = F)
```

```{r}
set.seed(11)
Full.2.sample.10 <- sample(c(1:17), size=10, replace=F)
sort(Full.2.sample.10, decreasing = F)
```
