"Muskleg Lake pack (7 wolves) was the only pack with pack specific data but only their moose kills were reported and no moose/wolf or moose kg/wolf was reported for that year or moose abundance was reported in an extractable way. Funny enough, they were the only point in which the 5.5 kg moose/wolf/day and 0.12kg moose/kg wolf/day was reported. So couldn't do pack specific extraction because it would only be a single data point.
