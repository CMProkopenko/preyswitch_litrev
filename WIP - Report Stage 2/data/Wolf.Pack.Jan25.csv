Based on the following, RB recalculated the data for the whole time period: ""Carcass use during the period of intensive tracking (mid-Feb-mid-Mar) was 56% for elk and 40% for moose (Table 2). Assuming that 75% by weight of a carcass was consumable (Peterson 1977), during this 19-day period 854 kg of elk and 407 kg of moose were available to the BL pack. Actual calculated consumption was 478 kg of elk and 163 kg of moose or 25 and 9/kg/day, respectively.
